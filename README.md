# TEKKIX -Beta
Tekkix is industrial focused technology mod that tries to enhance the vanilla experience, be accessible and most of all not as dominating over the vanilla experience (as many of the popular technology mods do).

Most of the mod is adding more advanced progression troughout all stages of the game with a focus on the end-game, but also adding more uses for underused items in the game (copper, amethyst, gold, rotten flesh etc). While making most items relevant through out the stages of the game. 

# ADDITIONS
- **Ores** : New ores like tin, silver, iridium, thorium, and more
- **Technology** & **sci**-**fi** : From bronze to nuclear power armor and light swords
- **Decoration** : Some decorational blocks with theming that aren't in vanilla
- **Magic** :  Items like flying boots and cloaking devices
- **Biomes** : Adds new unique biomes like the waste and the lush sanctuary
- **Simple** **design** : No extra GUIs or complicated machinery 
# SIDENOTE
I highly recommend playing with **JEI** (Just Enough Items) as I still have to figure out how to make the recipes show up before making the item.
